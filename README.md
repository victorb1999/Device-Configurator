# Device-Configurator
This configurator simulates classic platforms where everyone customizes their device according to a few predefined options. The difference from these is that with this configurator the options are not predefined, everyone can customizes their device as they wish, for example device dimensions, memory size, number of cameras etc.
The first step is to create the device by answering the questions. The price will be displayed at the end. If the price is too high or a higher price is affordable, the customer goes to step two. Otherwise the client can close the application.
The second step is to edit your device based on commands such as editbattery, editmemory etc. By each change, the updated price will be displayed.
